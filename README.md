If you get exceptions when you try and make a booking this should fix it. Regards, Max.

Why it happens... When you clone/fork a project, the *.db file is not included in Git (ignored by .gitignore).

EF Core migrations that create tables arenâ€™t automatically applied after cloning.

How to fix it... 

1. Open Visual Studio

2. Open Package Manager Console in Visual Studio

	Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Console

2. Run these commands in Powershell

	Add-Migration InitialCreate   # only if Migrations folder is empty

	Update-Database

This will create the SQLite database and build the Bookings table.
